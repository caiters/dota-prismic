      h2 Guild Raid Progression
      div#progression.progression
      //-
        TBD but we should be able to pull some info from the WoW api for this.
        Current plan:
        - Pick a character we know should echo DotA's progress (such as Shaeldre). Maybe even a couple different characters and take most progressed of them?
        - Check raid status for normal and heroic.
          - if it's 2 (which means fully completed) just show that the raid was cleared.
          - If it is 0, show no progress.
          - If it's 1, we go over each boss and show the status of that boss, including the timestamp of when it was killed
